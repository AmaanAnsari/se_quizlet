        <strong>Loops</strong>
    </p>
    <p>In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math. </p>

    <p>
        Given an integer <strong>N</strong>, print its first <strong>10</strong> multiples. Each multiple <strong>N x i</strong> (where 1 <= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line in the
        form: N x i = result.
